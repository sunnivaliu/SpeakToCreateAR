# Speak-To-Create: Real-Time Image Generation and Editing in Augmented Reality

We present a novel augmented reality (AR) system that uses voice commands and UI-based interactions for real-time image creation and editing. Powered by generative AI models like DALL-E and Quest Pro, it transforms voice prompts into dynamic AR visuals. Users can create images with commands like “create image” and modify them directly in physical space. Our pipeline integrates multimodal inputs, including voice, text, and selection tools, to map user intents to visual assets situated in passthrough space. Key features include selection-based image placement and runtime image editing. Our work contributes to the growing field of generative AR by introducing a multimodal interaction framework that demonstrates its potential for enhancing creativity and productivity in AR applications.
